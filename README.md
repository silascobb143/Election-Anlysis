Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
- Using this script on future election analysis will help save time when calculating the winner for the overal election while also providing quality information on vote counts and percentages.  One way this script could be used in other elections is if we have a way to pull that data out of an excel file.  Having that will allow us to find the desired results for any election.  One thing we could modify on this script is adding a list of the winner but also who came in second, third, etc..  This could be useful if we have a lot more candidates who are running in the election.
